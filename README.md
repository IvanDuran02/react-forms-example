This is just a example I made to look back on in other projects.

This is a dummy admin panel concept I put together; basically I have a create product page at the directory of /admin which then contains forms to fill out to create a new product.

entering a product name, price, description, and image to use for the product and hitting enter sends to a Database (MongoDB in this case) and then gets called from to the frontend and displayed as a product.

For now this is all it's used for :)
